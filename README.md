# Dentacoin - Health Care Industry should be in the hands of the people

Join us in creating a decentralised global currency based on the Ethereum blockchain.

[![Getting started with Dentacoin](https://dentacoin.com/web/img/Dentacoin_what.png)](https://d11oz1xo3vrzp6.cloudfront.net/publish/2017/3/21/1edbd2db1098476f840ecdad55f29769.mp4 "Getting started with Dentacoin")

Dentacoin is an industrial blockchain concept invented by Dentacoin Foundation in the Netherlands. The Dentacoin ERC20 token is configured to be used globally by all individuals.

## The starting point

Nowadays, each service industry, aiming at long-term success, is driven by the customers’ feedback. Healthcare Industry is no exception. No regulatory authority, no central institution, no powerful organization or individual could control the industry better than the patient community. People trust people. Always have, always will. Therefore, there is nothing more valuable to the industry players than a constant, trustworthy feedback from the patients. But what if this community doesn’t exist yet? This is where Dentacoin steps in.

## The concept

Through creating and implementing the first Blockchain-based platform for trusted dental treatment reviews, Dentacoin will allow patients to raise their voice. Simultaneously, dentists will have access to up-to-date, extremely valuable market research data and qualified patient feedback - the most powerful tool to improve service quality and to establish a loyal patient base. Through a self-executing Smart Contract, the Dentacoin review platform will assure optimal autonomy, trust, speed and safety. No manipulations are possible.

Dentacoin’s one-of-a-kind feedback platform will be supported by various other value-creating solutions devoted to the same purpose - to improve dental care quality worldwide. These include: a dental insurance model, a healthcare database, an aftercare mobile app, an educational website.

## The currency

As the DCN distribution model is aimed at value creation for the dental industry worldwide, each patient activity which generates value for the dental industry will be rewarded with Dentacoin. DCNs could later be used for paying dental treatments. Dentists, on the other hands, could consider DCN as a financial investment or they could remunerate employees for their extraordinary performance in the workplace. They could also pay suppliers in Dentacoin with no extra time, no middlemen and no more high international transaction costs. This direct connection between producers and dentists will then allow dentists to provide lower prices to patients.
The currency cycle is closed. Moreover, the establishment of Dentacoin as an industrial currency will put all market players - suppliers, dentists and patients - in a “win-win-win” situation.

## The value behind

To further increase its relevance as a store of value, each Dentacoin is legally bound to one share of the Dentacoin foundation and all its material and immaterial assets. This truly revolutionary concept not only backs Dentacoins directly with real world assets but allows all coin holders to vote for important decisions regarding the foundation. Due to the DCN being limited in amount and thus – inflation-protected, the value is expected to increase in time, giving the involved parties further benefits.
