Founded in March 2017, the Netherlands-based Dentacoin Foundation develops the first Blockchain solution for the global dental industry.

Driven by a vast community of progressive dentists, software developers and marketing specialists, the Foundation has managed to create a new dental ecosystem which favours all industry stakeholders: patients, dentists, manufacturers, suppliers, labs, insurance companies.  

Through a common, industry-specific cryptocurrency Dentacoin (DCN) and several Blockchain-based software tools, all market participants are securely interconnected, empowered to efficiently exchange information and values. 

The core purpose of the Foundation is to improve long-term health, reduce costs and pain, and continuously support the growth in the value of the DCN currency.
