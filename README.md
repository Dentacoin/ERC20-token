Founded in March 2017, the Netherlands-based Dentacoin Foundation develops the first Blockchain solution for the global dental industry. Driven by a vast community of progressive dentists, software developers and marketing specialists, the Foundation has managed to create a new dental ecosystem which favours all industry stakeholders: patients, dentists, manufacturers, suppliers, labs, insurance companies. The core purpose of the Foundation is to improve long-term health, reduce costs and pain, and continuously support the growth in the value of the DCN currency. The currency Dentacoin (DCN) is an Ethereum-based “utility token” which is embedded as an incentive in the Dentacoin tools. It is already being accepted as a means of payment by dental practices, shops, laboratories in 18 countries and can be easily exchanged to other crypto and fiat (USD, EUR, etc.) currencies. Every new participant in the community leads to increase of DCN value (“network effect”) - i.e. the more people use DCN, the higher its value grows in the long-term.
